I upgraded to Windows 10 a day or so ago and I was looking through my programs and under my Task Manager gt Start Up I found "psimouse" published by Pixart Imaging Inc. and from what I found out, it tracks your keyboard and mouse input. All I did was right click and select Disable and, hopefully, it does actually disable it. If anyone knows any different, please So I've just installed Windows 10 on my new PC and noticed in the startup tab on task manager there's something called pximouse, which is enabled by default. The actual application is named TiltWheelMouse.exe, and it's located in System32. Does anyone have any idea what this actually is, and why Windows has installed this on my computer? I can't seem to find much info on google about it, I'm also using a CM Storm Devastator mouse if that makes any difference.
